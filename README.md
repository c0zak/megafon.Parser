By default, you need a file that lists login-password pairs separated by a space. Then the data will be loaded into the SQL database.<br>
I do not know under what license such code can and should be placed. So I came up with my own:<br>
1) Indicate in the comments to your project that this code or part of it was used<br>
2) Say a beer toast in my honor. You can even two ;)<br>
3) Don't use this code for evil<br>
